In the folder source_photos, are a list of photos, with subdirectories
for each type of clothes item (shirts, pants, etc).

I want a static website that has an browsable and searchable index
into my clothes and hyperlinks to details of my clothes. 
The main page should contain controls for searching and filtering,
and a list of items.

The index page that lists the items should contain thumbnails of the items.

Items should be clickable that lead to a details page for the clicked item.

URLs for the items should be based on the name of the original file.

Details should contain a large image of the item along with metadata including
title, tags and notes.  title for this might be "Flower Jamaican
Shirt". Notes would be something like "Good for Jamaican Party".
Tags could be "Jamaican", "Party", "Festive", "Medium".

I want to use a json file to maintain records about the items.

The tech stack should use html, javascript, css and React.js.

Write a generator to take the source images and generate
a skeletong json file, thumbnails, and web-friendly images.

Use python for the site generator.

Use uv for the project management tool.

This site may evolve to a full-blown backend so keep that it
mind as you generate code.
