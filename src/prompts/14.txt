Create new code to write the sheet with the data that was generated in WardrobeGenerator.
In WardrobeGenerator, use the SheetsWriter class.
Update the SheetsWriter class to use SheetUtils.
In WardrobeGenerator, modify generate_json_data to:
* be renamed to generate_items_data
* return the items instead of writing to the json file.
* write the data to a file in a separate method calleed write_json_data_to_file
* write the data to the spreadsheet using SheetsWriter

In SheetWriter:
* Create a new create_sheet method in the case where the sheet doesn't exist - returns the id of the newly-created sheet
* Create a new create_or_update_sheet method - calls find_sheet_in_folder, then create_sheet if not found.  Return the sheet id
* Create a new write_sheet_data method - takes sheet id, header rows, data rows and writes the data

In SheetsWriter.create_sheet_and_write_data,
* rename the create_sheet_and_write_data method to upsert_sheet_data
* Use the newly-created methods to implement the upsert logic
