At the top of the site, I see the message "79 items in your wardrobe".
When I search, the number of items displayed is less than the total
number of items.  For example, if I type "hawaiian" in the search box,
I see 4 items.  Can you modify the message to say "<x> out of <total> items shown",
where <x> is the number of items in the search results, and <total> is the total
number of items in the database?  If all items, are shown, show the
original message: "<total> items in your wardrobe"
